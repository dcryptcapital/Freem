ðŸš€ Revolutionizing the Future of Work
Freem embarks on the purpose to redefine the future of work. We're crafting an organizational model fuelled by purpose, uniting and activating the full spectrum of human potential. Envision a decentralized, self-organizing, agentic-assisted value economy, collectively owned by workers united in a shared purpose. This is the world Freem envisions.  To build this we need to create a tool that aligns people with their values and helps them to discover and develop the skills which would allow them to contribute to society with this alignment.  The outcome is Skill-AI.
